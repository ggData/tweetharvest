## Description

`tweetharvest` is a Python utility to monitor Twitter conversations around a small set of hashtags, and to store statuses (tweets) in that stream to a MongoDB database. The intended use case: monitoring discussions around a given event or campaign for later analysis using any tools that can access MongoDB. An example is given of simple analysis using an IPython notebook.
